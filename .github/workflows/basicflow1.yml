May be one of: `none`, `Minimal`, `normal`, `detailed`, `diagnostic`

    output_level: # optional
    # GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate against API calls to attach
report to Workflow Run.

    github_token: # optional, default is ${{github.token}}
    # If true, will skip attaching the Tests Result report to
the Workflow Run using a Check Run.  Useful if you just
want to produce a Gist-based report via the `gist_name`
and `gist_token` input parameters.

    skip_check_run: # optional
    # Comma-separated list of one or more directories to scan for code 
coverage, relative to the root of the project. Will include all .ps1
and .psm1 files under these directories recursively.

    coverage_paths: # optional
    # The name of the code coverage report object that will be attached
to the Workflow Run.  Defaults to the name
`COVERAGE_RESULTS_<datetime>` where `<datetime>` is in the form
`yyyyMMdd_hhmmss`.

    coverage_report_name: # optional
    # The title of the code coverage report that will be embedded in the
report itself, which defaults to the same as the
`code_coverage_report_name` input.

    # Minimum allowed coverage percentage as an integer.
    minimum_coverage: # optional
    # Fail the action when the minimum coverage was not met.
    fail_below_threshold: # optional
    # If true, will skip attaching the Tests Result report to the

characters that is not accepted by Github REST and GraphQL APIs
